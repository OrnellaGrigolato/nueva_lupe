Nueva Lupe is a promotional landing page I developed for a small take out restourant in my neighborhood.

## How I Worked on this Project

The idea came from detecting certain flaws in the company's website. I noticed that **it was not adapted to mobile devices** and that **the address indicated on the map in the contact section was incorrect**. In addition, other small details such as **the copyright date was outdated** and **the favicon that appeared in the window when opening the page was the logo of the development company and not the business**. Therefore, I decided to try to fix these issues to increase the quality of the Nueva Lupe website, as well as take the opportunity to gain experience.

The company's page looked like this:

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment and create a visually appealing product to increase business sales.

- I listed the problems and devised solutions.

- Based on the requirements I defined I created, completely from scratch, the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/2HVDDd4tyzGWD810yg7ITA/Nueva-Lupe), focusing on following the UI/UX rules I know.

- I wrote quality code and commented sections that required it, making it easily maintainable. I was concerned with creating a product that does not require ongoing maintenance, to avoid constant overhead for the owner. For example, dates are updated using the Date object provided by Js and do not require someone to modify them manually.

- I used pure CSS and vanilla JS because I did not consider necessary any framework or component-based library as this is a simple project, as this would increase costs and make less likely the stability over time of the final product.
